      Simple versus average inflation targeting: a comparison
    </h1>
    <div class="container1">
      <p>Work in progress</p>

    <div class="container1">
        <p>I set up a New Keynesian model with cost-push shocks
          to compare the equilibrium and welfare properties of targeting 
          yearly inflation versus targeting average inflation. I find that (i)
          average targeting reduces the volatility of the welfare-relevant output 
          gap on impact, but the response of inflation on impact may be 
          either accentuated by the smaller response of the gap, or 
          cushioned via inflation expectations; (ii) average targeting 
          prevents interest rates from falling below zero more easily 
          than simple targeting when the cost-push shock is small, while 
          large shocks cause the opposite; and (iii) a policymaker with 
          no commitment using a textbook calibration of the model prefers 
          targeting two- or three-year average inflation than shorter 
          horizons. <a href="files/AvTargeting_Nov2021.pdf" class="high-light" target="_blank">Draft</a>. <a href="files/AvTargeting_code.m" class="high-light" target="_blank">Code</a>.</p>

      Sharing a Government? A Spatial Model of Centralisation Versus Decentralisation

          I incorporate a spatial dimension to the analysis in 
          <a href="files/Ventura.pdf" class="high-light" target="_blank">Ventura (2019)</a> to account for the 
          fact that externalities will depend on how far apart regions are. Using this new framework, 
          I perform a positive and a normative analysis on which parliaments will/should have decision 
          powers upon projects. I find that regions no longer unanimously agree when voting the fiscal 
          constitution, and the delegation of decision powers to the union/regional parliament(s) can be 
          suboptimal. Voting the constitution under an hypothetical veil of ignorance could solve problems 
          in a world where there are a large number of regions and where the representative of a region has 
          rational expectations. <a href="files/Ventura_Extension.pdf" class="high-light" target="_blank">Draft</a>.</p>

      The effect of market potential on growth: a spatial analysis of population concentration in Spain (1900-2010)

    <div class="container1">
        <p>I perform a spatial analysis of population growth across Spain 
          during 1900-2010. A better market access is found to increasingly 
          improve the growth prospects of municipalities in the earliest 
          phase of market integration, whereas this positive effect 
          diminishes afterwards. I also find that the earliest decades of 
          Franco’s dictatorship diminished the gravitational force of 
          market potential, and that market potential is already becoming 
          a locational disadvantage for large cities –but not for the 
          municipalities neighboring these cities. <a href="files/lse_thesis.pdf" class="high-light" target="_blank">Draft</a>.

      Modern economic growth and convergence: the long-run evolution of regional inequality in Spain (1860-2010)

      </div>
      <p>I perform an analysis of sigma and beta convergence for Spanish regions during the period 1860-2010 
        using different spatial units and time intervals. Growth regressions are run unconditionally using 
        a Generalised Least Squares estimator and also conditionally by using a fixed effects estimator and 
        a panel data two-step Generalised Method of Moments estimator. My results confirm the existence of 
        conditional beta convergence for Spanish regions over the whole studied period; however, different 
        time partitions for growth regressions show the convergence parameter has not remained constant at 
        all throughout different periods. I conclude that, although the neoclassical growth model with 
        endogenous savings provides a satisfactory picture of convergence in Spain if the whole period 
        1860-2010 is considered, other forces apart from diminishing returns to capital accumulation also 
        play a role. Published <a href="https://repositori.upf.edu/handle/10230/42256" class="high-light" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      Do economies respond with neoclassical growth dynamics to natural disasters? Evidence from panel data on the effect of natural disasters on growth
    </h1>
    <div class="container1">
      <p>June 2020. Joint work with fellow students Gerard Maideu Morera (TSE) and Romain Bretenou.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container1">
      <p>We analyze the dynamic growth effects of natural disasters using a panel IV fixed effects model, 
        and we analyze whether these effects are in line with what neoclassical growth models predict for 
        the cases where natural disasters hit an economy. We find that the impact effect of disasters on per 
        capita GDP growth can be explained by including a quadratic term of monetary damage over GDP, 
        which suggests there is evidence of neoclassical growth dynamics at least for relatively small 
        disasters. However, results are inconclusive for larger disasters. <a href="files/tse_thesis.pdf" class="high-light" target="_blank">Draft</a>.</p>

        We observe that both children and adolescents create price bubbles regardless 
        of the treatment, despite children never bursting them. In addition, we statistically prove that 
        bubbles in children are larger both in intensity and duration. Finally, we show that Huber, Kirchler
